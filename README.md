# camagru

First project of the web branch : Camagru.

This web project is challenging you to create a small web application allowing you to make basic photo and video editing using your webcam and some predefined images.

App’s users should be able to select an image in a list of superposable images (for instance a picture frame, or other “we don’t wanna know what you are using this for” objects), take a picture with his/her webcam and admire the result that should be mixing both pictures.

• Server-side : Only PHP with standard library is used.

• Client-side: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
